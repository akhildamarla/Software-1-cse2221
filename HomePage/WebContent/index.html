<h1>About Akhil Damarla</h1>
<p> Hi, my name is Akhil Damarla, and I'm a senior at Olentangy Berlin High School. This semester I am taking 3 <br />
classes: Software 1, Engineering 2, and Western Art. I am really excited to take classes at OSU this year as  <br />
I am expecting to go to college here. My goal is earn a degree in CSE and purse an MBA on the side. I'm really <br />
looking forward to this class as I love coding and especially in this class we look beyond the language and get to  <br />
work on challenging projects. I hope to make the most of this class and know I have a lot to learn.  <br />
 <br />The following is a picture of myself:
